    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "Our integrated platform offers two virtual assistants, Meetween Agentar and Meetween Butler, to facilitate and optimise communication in a variety of meeting contexts. On the one hand, Meetween Agentar acts as a proxy for meeting participants who cannot attend, mimicking their behaviour and engaging in discussions on their behalf. On the other hand, Meetween Butler assists with meeting flow and can be called upon for tasks like summarisation and real-time translation. Boasting an extensive array of features, Meetween enhances communication, intelligently unmutes participants, and leverages company-specific and individual-private data to refine language-related tasks. Additionally, it supplies real-time meeting summaries, transcriptions, and translations for all 24 official EU languages. Built upon an open-source videoconferencing system, Meetween employs a low-latency data processing methodology to simultaneously manage text, audio, and video modalities. This integration allows for precise estimation of articulation, body joint angles, and gaze direction, fostering seamless interaction and collaboration. Ultimately, the Meetween project prioritises ethical and data privacy considerations (WP5) while fostering enhanced communication and collaboration among users (WP6)."
