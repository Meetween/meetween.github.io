summary: TAUS was founded in 2005 as a think tank with a mission to automate and innovate translation. We began by evangelizing the simple idea that machine translation is a useful tool for the translation industry and emphasized the need for innovation, open platforms and cross-industry cooperation. Ideas transformed into actions.<br>We became the language data network offering the largest industry-shared repository of data, deep know-how in language engineering and a network of Human Language Project workers around the globe.<br>Our mission today is to empower global enterprises and their service and technology providers with data solutions that help them to communicate in all languages, faster, better and more efficiently.
